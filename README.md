Cog deployment of [whisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX/blob/main/whisperx/asr.py),
a library that adds batch processing on top of whisper (and also faster-whisper),
leading to very fast audio transcription.

This repository only manages the deployment of WhisperX to my personal
Replicate model, please do not report any WhisperX own issues here.

The model is deployed at https://replicate.com/sterliakov/whisperx-with-prompt
